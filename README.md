Windshaft-CartoDB
==================

This is the CartoDB map tiler. It extends Windshaft with some extra
functionality and custom filters for authentication

* reads dbname from subdomain and cartodb redis for pretty tile urls
* configures windshaft to publish cartodb_id as the interactivity layer
* gets the default geometry type from the cartodb redis store
* allows tiles to be styled individually
* provides a link to varnish high speed cache
* provides a infowindow endpoint for windshaft
* provides a map_metadata endpoint for windshaft

Install
-------

```
git clone
npm install
```

Note that the ```npm install``` step will populate the node_modules/
directory with modules, some of which being compiled on demand. If you
happen to have startup errors you may need to force rebuilding those
modules. At any time just wipe out the node_modules/ directory and run
```npm install``` again.

Configure
---------

Edit config/environments/<env>.js files

Look at lib/cartodb/server_options for more on config

Run
---

```
node app.js [development | production]
```

Note that caches are kept in redis. If you're not seeing what
you expect there may be out-of-sync records in there.
Take a look: http://redis.io/commands
